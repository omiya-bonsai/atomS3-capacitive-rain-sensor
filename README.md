  "timestamp": 1691123456
}
```

### Data Field Description

- `id`: Device ID
- `baseline`: Baseline value (dry state reference value)
- `current`: Current measurement value
- `change`: Change rate (%)
- `rain`: Rain detection state (true/false)
- `method`: Measurement method in use (1-4)

- `cable_ok`: Cable connection state
- `errors`: Consecutive error count
- `timestamp`: UNIX timestamp (Japan time)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### üü¢ Green flashing continues
**Cause**: Sensor connection failure or calibration failure
**Solution**:
1. Check PIN1, PIN2 wiring
2. Ensure sensor is completely dry
3. Restart and recalibrate

#### üî¥ Red flashing
**Cause**: Cable disconnection or WiFi disconnection
**Solution**:
1. Check sensor cable connection
2. Check WiFi settings in config.h
3. Check distance to WiFi router

#### No notifications
**Cause**: Time restriction or Pushover configuration error
**Solution**:
1. Check if current time is within 07:00-19:00 range
2. Check Pushover API token/User key
3. Check 3-hour cooldown period

#### Too many false detections
**Cause**: Threshold too low
**Solution**:
1. Change `RAIN_THRESHOLD_PERCENT` from 15‚Üí20%
2. Review sensor installation location
3. Move to location less affected by wind

### Debug Mode

Enable the following flags during development/testing:

```cpp
#define DEBUG_IGNORE_TIME_LIMITS true   // Ignore time restrictions
#define DEBUG_SHORT_COOLDOWN true       // 1-minute cooldown
```

## üåê Application Examples

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 24/7 Operation Guide

### Recommendations for Long-term Operation

#### Hardware
- **Stable power supply**: Use USB adapters with stable 5V/1A or higher
- **WiFi router**: Equipment that can stably supply 2.4GHz band
- **Installation environment**: Install in a location not exposed to rain, with only sensor part outdoors

#### Software Monitoring
- **System health**: Monitor operation status via MQTT topic `/health`
- **Automatic restart**: Preventive restart is performed every 7 days
- **Error notifications**: Error status is notified via PUSHOVER

#### Regular Maintenance
- **Monthly inspection**: Monthly operation check and log verification
- **Sensor cleaning**: Clean sensor part monthly
- **Connection check**: Check WiFi signal strength and MQTT connection status

#### Troubleshooting
- **LED status check**: Error status displayed with red flashing
- **Serial logs**: Detailed debug information output to serial port
- **Forced restart**: Manual reset possible by unplugging and plugging power

## üîí Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Please manage the following information appropriately as confidential

- **config.h**: Contains WiFi passwords and API keys
- **GitHub upload**: Add config.h to .gitignore
- **MQTT broker**: Set appropriate access control
- **Pushover**: Strict management of API token and User key
